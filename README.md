# UTA-CSE6389

Reference code for UTA CSE-6389-001-ADV MM, GRAPHICS, IMAGE PROC project
### Project 1
This project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary classification using provided MRI data to distinguish between Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients and healthy people (CN). A sample code for loading the data and a basic CNN model is provided. Your task is to design and optimize a CNN model to achieve the best possible performance. You will submit a comprehensive report detailing the model architecture, performance metrics, and conclusions, along with the your code implementation.
### Project 2
This project involves developing a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for binary classification using functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC) data to distinguish between Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) and healthy controls (CN). You will design and optimize a GCN model that leverages both FC and SC data to classify individuals as AD or CN. The deliverables include a report on the model architecture, training process, performance metrics, and code implementation.
### Project 3
This project involves developing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for binary classification using fMRI signals with multiple time points for different regions of interest (ROIs) to distinguish between Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and healthy controls (CN). The input consists of time-series data from fMRI signals for each brain region. You will redesign and optimize an RNN model to process the temporal dynamics of these signals and classify individuals as AD or CN. The deliverables include a report on the model architecture, training process, performance metrics, and code implementation.
